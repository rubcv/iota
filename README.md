# IOTA

#### Main issues with a common Blockchain Network (e.g. Bitcoin)


1. **Scalability**

    * Bitcoin's blockchain takes about 10 min to confirm a transaction.
    * +200K unconfirmed transactions at a time.
    * Bad for micro-payments (buy a coffee).

1. **Transactions per second (TPS)**
    
    * Visa - 2000 TPS
    * Paypal - 155 TPS
    * Ethereum - 100 TPS
    * Bitcoin - 5-7 TPS

    * IOTA - 1000+ TPS 

1. **Fees**

    * Need to pay a fee per transaction.
    * The fee can be larger than the transaction itself.

1. **Computing mining power**
    * More computing power on each block.
    * Transaction speed declines as network increases (need to validate more transactions).
    * Mining is centralized by giant mining pools.

1. **Vulnerable to quantum computer**

    * A quantum computer is 17 billion times more efficient in calculating a hash (51% control of the network attack).

## IOTA
#### IOTA uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

* High transaction throughput (paralellizing transaction validations).
* More participants -> less confirmation time.

#### No miners

* Blockchain: Participants of the network decoupled into miners and users, miners compete with each other and users only send/receive transactions (centralization can occur, mining pools).

* IOTA: A transaction validates two past transactions, members are both participants of the consensus and users.

#### No transaction fees

* All the network is involved in the approval of transactions (not only a small subset part of the consensus (only miners)), as a result the consensus is not decoupled from the transaction make process, hence no need to pay fees.

#### Quantum computer resistant

* Uses winternitz one time signature.

### Transaction process

![Sending Transaction](img/sending-transaction.png)

1. **Select IOTA Network**: Choose a node that is going to be the entry point to the Tangle, IOTA networks can be private (Hornet) or permissionless (Mainnet, Devnet, Comnet)


1. **Unconfirmed transactions selection (tips)**: MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) is used to randomly select two unconfirmed transactions, which will be referenced by your transaction.

1. **Proof of Work**: Prevent **double spend attack**, (send a fake transaction record to the destinatary while keeping the original amount due to the long confirmation time, or sending multiple packets to the network after receiving the counterpartyâ€™s assets or services, thus keeping both the received goods and the sent amount) This process makes any attempt to duplicate or falsify the blockchain significantly more difficult to execute, because the attacker would have to go back and re-mine every single block with the new fraudulent transaction(s) on it. 
1. **Broadcast transaction to the network**: Broadcast the transaction to the network, someone chooses your transaction in the tip selection and validates it, then your transaction is confirmed.


### Definitions

##### Minimum Weight Magnitude (MWM)
A setting for proof of work that defines the number of trailing zeros that a transaction hash must have to be accepted by nodes in an IOTA network
